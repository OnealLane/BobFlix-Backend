They find new purpose when their friend, Brodie, informs them a movie is being made featuring two infamous characters based on their likenesses. After visiting one of the creators of the Bluntman and Chronic, Holden McNeil, they set out to get what fat movie cash they deserve and hopefully put an end to people slandering them on the Internet. Along the way, they learn the rules of the road from a hitchhiking George Carlin, ride with a group of gorgeous jewel thieves, and incur the wrath of a hapless wildlife marshal for liberating an orangutan named Suzanne. The quest takes them from New Jersey to Hollywood where a showdown involving the police, the jewel thieves, and the Bluntman and Chronic filmmakers will decide the fate of Suzanne, Jay, Silent Bob, and their good names.",

Meanwhile, Bob Wiley is a recluse who is so afraid to leave his own apartment that he has to talk himself out the door. When he is pawned off on Leo by a psychotherapist colleague, he becomes attached to him. Leo finds Bob extremely annoying. When Leo accompanies his wife, Faye, his daughter, Anna, and his son, Sigmund, to a peaceful New Hampshire lakeside cottage for a month-long vacation, he thinks he's been freed from Bob. Leo expects to mesmerize his family with his prowess as a brilliant husband and remarkable father who knows all there is to know about instructing Faye and raising Anna and Sigmund. But Bob isn't going to let him enjoy a quiet summer by the lake. By cleverly tricking the telephone operator at Leo's exchange, Bob discovers the whereabouts of him and his family. Despite his phobia about traveling alone, Bob somehow manages to talk himself onto a bus, and he arrives in New Hampshire. Leo's vacation comes to a screeching halt the moment he sees him. With his witty personality, his ability to manipulate people, and his good sense of humor, he quickly becomes an annoyance to Leo, but not to Faye, Anna, and Sigmund, because they think he is fun while Leo is dull. Fearing that he's losing his family to him, Leo frantically tries to find a way to make him go back to New York City, and it's not as easy as he had hoped. He finds himself stepping outside the law to try to get Bob to stay away from Faye, Anna, and Sigmund--he slowly goes berserk, and makes plans to kill Bob.",

Bob insists that everyone \"feel\" rather than intellectualize their emotions, and Carol pronounces \"that's beautiful\" after anyone says anything even remotely personal. Ted and Alice humor their friends, but a good-natured sexual tension is obviously at work among the foursome.",

His testimony remains the most controversial and important UFO story of all time. This film intimately chronicles the challenges and travails of a cosmic whistleblower. Burdened with a revolutionary secret, he had to choose between his oath to his country or his conscience. Corbell's film explores Lazar's groundbreaking claims and the devastating impact it has had on his life over the course of the last 30 years, including rare and never before revealed footage guaranteed to alter the landscape of the debate. He blew the whistle, shocked the world, then went silent - until now.",

Bob goes to Ethiopia and, horrified at the scale of the famine, plans a global rock concert to be staged simultaneously in England and America the next summer. He brings in hard-headed rock promoter Harvey Goldsmith who provides a realistic anchor to Bob's idealistic wish-list of performers. Preparations are fraught with arguments, and Bob is especially disappointed not to secure Bruce Springsteen, in anticipation of whose services he postponed the event. After addressing his old school, where he was less than academically bright but hopes to inspire the students, and with five days before the big event, Bob gets involved with the complicated matter of financial logistics and organizing international broadcasts but gets Prince Charles and Princess Diana to attend simply by asking them. Finally the day of the concerts arrives and, as Paul McCartney sings 'Let it Be', Harvey and Bob know that they have triumphed. The show over, the two men sit alone to reflect on matters.",

                            Plot = "Jay and Silent Bob Get Old: Pt. 1 is a one-night-only DirecTV exclusive showcasing seventy-five minutes of the four hour \"Jay and Silent Bob Get Old: Teabagging in the UK\" DVD special due out on August 14, 2012. The flimsy release exclusively on a satellite company isn't really justifiable, but the treat isn't discouraged at all. This is a short and lively little taste of what will most likely come out on that DVD.Longtime filmmaker Kevin Smith and his other half, Jason Mewes, take the stage in the United Kingdom, reminding themselves and us that fans of theirs are not restricted to the United States, but are scattered all over the world. Mewes and Smith perform in front of a sold out audience in a luxurious theater, giving us their usual schtick, composed of grotesque jokes, highly descriptive retellings of past events, and basically anything as far away from the term \"luxurious\" as possible.Their banter begins with them reminiscing about past sexual encounters in England, which quickly transcends into an entertaining fifteen minutes of Smith describing the film Bedknobs and Broomsticks to Mewes, while the two put their own graphic spin on it. This will eventually evolve into an enlightening commentary on the Jason Mewes method of having sex, which quickly turns sentimental at the end only to go into a raunchy game the two play on stage where they call on random audience members to perform in acts of sheer depravity. To write them down and describe them in this review will commit so many sins that \"confessions\" would then become a daily thing for not only myself but you, the reader.It is no question that there is fun to be had here. The question is how much fun? The answer is slightly less than what we're used to. With Smith breathlessly doing one man shows across the country and releasing many of his lengthy Q&amp;A specials on DVD (his most recent one was the EPIX exclusive, Kevin Smith: Burn in Hell; another informative and highly engaging show I awarded three and a half stars to earlier this year), we are so used to him providing us with a plethora of wit and insight as to what it means to be a \"free bird\" type filmmaker in 2012. He is known for going into the productions of his films in great detail, leaving no stone unturned, and giving us meticulous little details that will inevitably allow him to give us another story right in the middle of the one currently being told. It is this reason, among dozens of others, that he is my favorite filmmaker in the business today.Jay and Silent Bob Get Old does not deliver that familiar style of schtick, but something along the lines of what Smith and Mewes' podcast (or self-proclaimed \"SModcast\") of the same name would dive into. The talking, like usual, is disorganized and totally on-the-spot material, but instead of detailing past events on the set, both men spend the time cracking sex joke after sex joke, with Mewes providing us with the pleasure of watching these events mimed by himself. The acts and conversations are fun and energetic, but not on-par with the informative stuff we are used to seeing.As a further exploration on these two open men, Jay and Silent Bob Get Old: Pt. 1 is a bit underdeveloped and shaky on its feet. As a little special that shows these men just doing what they do best, it does a worthy and notable job. Seventy-five minutes is also the perfect running time for something like this. Even as a worthy fan of both parties, four hours of enduring their sexual banter would be the equivalent of hopping from orgy party to orgy party one late night downtown; tiring and emptying on all levels.Starring: Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith.

His forthright approach, insightful wit and dedication to improving the lives of others has made him an inspiration not just in his parish but throughout Australia. In Bob We Trust begins with Father Bob facing his greatest challenge. Despite the 'promise of a parish for life', the Archbishop of Melbourne invites him to retire. What follows is a David and Goliath story of biblical proportions as the dissident priest, loved by the faithful and the secular alike, resists the authority of the church to remove him, only to encounter treachery and betrayal. In Bob We Trust follows irreverent philosopher and working class hero Father Bob over three years, on a journey which is by turns inspirational and shocking, eye-opening and joyous, revealing behind-the-scenes drama that has to be seen to be believed.",
