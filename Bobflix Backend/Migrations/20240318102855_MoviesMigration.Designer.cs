They find new purpose when their friend, Brodie, informs them a movie is being made featuring two infamous characters based on their likenesses. After visiting one of the creators of the Bluntman and Chronic, Holden McNeil, they set out to get what fat movie cash they deserve and hopefully put an end to people slandering them on the Internet.

Meanwhile, Bob Wiley is a recluse who is so afraid to leave his own apartment that he has to talk himself out the door. When he is pawned off on Leo by a psychotherapist colleague, he becomes attached to him. Leo finds Bob extremely annoying. When Leo accompanies his wife, Faye, his daughter, Anna, and his son, Sigmund, to a peaceful New Hampshire lakeside cottage for a month-long vacation, he thinks he's been freed from Bob. Leo expects to mesmerize his family with his prowess as a brilliant husband and remarkable father who knows all there is to know about instructing Faye and raising Anna and Sigmund. But Bob isn't going to let him enjoy a quiet summer by the lake. By cleverly tricking the telephone operator at Leo's exchange, Bob discovers the whereabouts of him and his family. Despite his phobia about traveling alone, Bob somehow manages to talk himself onto a bus, and he arrives in New Hampshire. Leo's vacation comes to a screeching halt the moment he sees him. With his witty personality, his ability to manipulate people, and his good sense of humor, he quickly becomes an annoyance to Leo, but not to Faye, Anna, and Sigmund, because they think he is fun while Leo is dull. Fearing that he's losing his family to him, Leo frantically tries to find a way to make him go back to New York City, and it's not as easy as he had hoped. He finds himself stepping outside the law to try to get Bob to stay away from Faye, Anna, and Sigmund--he slowly goes berserk, and makes plans to kill Bob.",

His testimony remains the most controversial and important UFO story of all time. This film intimately chronicles the challenges and travails of a cosmic whistleblower. Burdened with a revolutionary secret, he had to choose between his oath to his country or his conscience. Corbell's film explores Lazar's groundbreaking claims and the devastating impact it has had on his life over the course of the last 30 years, including rare and never before revealed footage guaranteed to alter the landscape of the debate. He blew the whistle, shocked the world, then went silent - until now.",

The flimsy release exclusively on a satellite company isn't really justifiable, but the treat isn't discouraged at all. This is a short and lively little taste of what will most likely come out on that DVD.Longtime filmmaker Kevin Smith and his other half, Jason Mewes, take the stage in the United Kingdom, reminding themselves and us that fans of theirs are not restricted to the United States, but are scattered all over the world. Mewes and Smith perform in front of a sold out audience in a luxurious theater, giving us their usual schtick, composed of grotesque jokes, highly descriptive retellings of past events, and basically anything as far away from the term \"luxurious\" as possible.Their banter begins with them reminiscing about past sexual encounters in England, which quickly transcends into an entertaining fifteen minutes of Smith describing the film Bedknobs and Broomsticks to Mewes, while the two put their own graphic spin on it. This will eventually evolve into an enlightening commentary on the Jason Mewes method of having sex, which quickly turns sentimental at the end only to go into a raunchy game the two play on stage where they call on random audience members to perform in acts of sheer depravity. To write them down and describe them in this review will commit so many sins that \"confessions\" would then become a daily thing for not only myself but you, the reader.It is no question that there is fun to be had here. The question is how much fun? The answer is slightly less than what we're used to. With Smith breathlessly doing one man shows across the country and releasing many of his lengthy Q&amp;A specials on DVD (his most recent one was the EPIX exclusive, Kevin Smith: Burn in Hell; another informative and highly engaging show I awarded three and a half stars to earlier this year), we are so used to him providing us with a plethora of wit and insight as to what it means to be a \"free bird\" type filmmaker in 2012. He is known for going into the productions of his films in great detail, leaving no stone unturned, and giving us meticulous little details that will inevitably allow him to give us another story right in the middle of the one currently being told. It is this reason, among dozens of others, that he is my favorite filmmaker in the business today.Jay and Silent Bob Get Old does not deliver that familiar style of schtick, but something along the lines of what Smith and Mewes' podcast (or self-proclaimed \"SModcast\") of the same name would dive into. The talking, like usual, is disorganized and totally on-the-spot material, but instead of detailing past events on the set, both men spend the time cracking sex joke after sex joke, with Mewes providing us with the pleasure of watching these events mimed by himself. The acts and conversations are fun and energetic, but not on-par with the informative stuff we are used to seeing.As a further exploration on these two open men, Jay and Silent Bob Get Old: Pt. 1 is a bit underdeveloped and shaky on its feet. As a little special that shows these men just doing what they do best, it does a worthy and notable job. Seventy-five minutes is also the perfect running time for something like this. Even as a worthy fan of both parties, four hours of enduring their sexual banter would be the equivalent of hopping from orgy party to orgy party one late night downtown; tiring and emptying on all levels.Starring: Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith.

Dr. Ballard and a team of experts -- including Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin; TV personality Bill Nye the Science Guy; and oceanographers, climatologists, professional surfers, fishermen and boat pilots -- travel the world, seeking answers to questions at the root of earth and humanity. To find these answers, Dr. Ballard visits breathtaking sites from volcanoes submerged more than 3,000 feet beneath the Hawaiian islands, to shipwrecks on forgotten ancient Greek trade routes, to cracks in the ocean floor where red-hot magma pours into open water, with cameras capturing never-before-seen rock formations, lava vents and unusual species that call the ocean bottom home. The five episodes are: \"Fires of Creation,\" which highlights his trip from the top of Mauna Kea volcano to the crown of Loihi, its submerged cousin known as the youngest volcano in the Hawaiian Archipelago, showing how heat and magma bubble up to create life and new land masses; \"Wrecks of the Abyss,\" which documents his deep-water search for ancient shipwrecks in the Mediterranean, informing our understanding of maritime travel from Greece to Egypt in the ancient world; \"It's Alive,\" which features his search for life in the darkness and chill of waters thousands of feet beneath the surface on the slopes of the Mid-Ocean ridges, where molten lava superheats the ocean, mixing in the nutrients for marine life that has adapted to the harsh environment; \"Ocean's Fury,\" which seeks to understand whether the ocean is growing more dangerous by the day and how rogue waves are getting larger and more frequent on the seas; and \"Inner vs. Outer Space,\" which explores how the Earth's waters -- and not outer space -- may be the key to long-term survival of the human race.",

The Story is bad, the script is awful, the set is a blue-screen, just one actor does a decent job and there's millions of dollars worth of special effects. That pretty much summarizes like every big blockbuster of 2014 and most likely 2015.So there is a certain \"aww this will be bad anyway\" mood when I'm watching a movie. This one however deserves something like a couple of anti-Oscars for the acting, the effects, the story, the direction, the producing, the set, the script, the music and everything because I cant possibly imagine anything to be worse than it is. Usually trash movies are at least funny but this one somehow manages to as fun as.... I cant even think of a decent comparison.But after watching this mess I promise you that you will look at all the other movies with a different perspective. You'll start to appreciate the acting of a Kristen Steward, the story of a Transformers movie and even jar-jar binks stepping into poo doesn't look that bad anymore.So in the end this movie is about 70min of pure pain but you get a lot for watching it. Have a try, see how long you can bare to watch it, make bets with your friends if you like.",

It is always hard to summarize how truly great the show is in such a short time frame. The situation is very similar to Jim Rome is Burning. The radio shows are infinitely better than the television shows will ever be. At least Bob and Tom is the live recording of the radio show, Jim Rome's show is simply a regurgitation. The show also leaves a lot to be desired as far as the camera work goes. The only thing it seems to really highlight is how little the hosts seem to actually pay attention to the guests. Funny to watch, but leaves a sense of Bob and Tom not caring and being off in their own worlds.Watchable but not a Must See by any means.",

Life After BOB asks: How will life lived with AI transform the archetypal scripts that guide our sense of a meaningful existence? In episode one - The Chalice Study - neural engineer Dr. Wong has installed an experimental AI named BOB (\"Bag of Beliefs\") into the nervous system of his 10-year-old daughter Chalice. Designed to guide Chalice through the challenges of growing up in a volatile world, BOB confronts more and more of the conflicts in Chalice's life on her behalf, while Chalice grows increasingly irrelevant and escapist. As Dr. Wong begins to favor the BOB side of his daughter, and as BOB threatens to do the job of living Chalice's life better than she can, Chalice jealously wonders: what is left for her classic human self to do?",

An artistic and crazy man of theatre, dead in the 80's, turns her on passions and doubts already forgotten. She will find in a city of Marche, where her research on Roberto Cimetta started. This artist, who is easy-going and without roots, always traveling to European festivals, surfaces in the eyes of who loved him and hated him, and Anna gets involved in his story to such an extent that she imagines scenes, relives situations and suggestions, trying to put in order her past. She feels that Roberto's life is linked to hers. And only a thread brings her to Tommaso, Roberto's son, and she can discover, in his clear and deep gaze, another piece of truth about that man, and she can make sense of all the story, finding another focus for her life.

Appearing unannounced in small venues, the Revue culminated in \"The Night of the Hurricane\" benefit at Madison Square Garden for wrongly-convicted boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter. In his first interview in 30 years, \"The Hurricane\" tells all. Folk legend Ramblin' Jack Elliott, violinist Scarlet Rivera, bassist Rob Stoner, and Ms. Jacques Levy reveal the inside story of the Desire album, Joey Gallo, the Rolling Thunder Revue and the maligned tour film, Renaldo and Clara. Following his reinvention as \"The Entertainer\" in 1978, Bob Dylan fell into the Arms of the Lord through the Vineyard Christian Fellowship Church. Dylan made three Gospel albums, winning a Grammy for \"Gotta Serve Somebody.\" However, his radical new direction alienated fans and enraged critics as he preached evangelical messages from the Book of Revelation. In his first-ever interview, Dylan's Bible class teacher, Pastor Bill Dwyer, describes Dylan's born-again transformation. Legendary Slow Train Coming producer Jerry Wexler, background singer Regina McCrary, keyboardist Spooner Oldham, songwriter Al Kasha, San Francisco Chronicle rock reporter Joel Selvin, AJ Weberman and others tell the tale of Bob Dylan's Gospel Years. Director & Producer Joel Gilbert (Bob Dylan 1966 World Tour-The Home Movies, 2003 and Bob Dylan World Tours 1966-1974-Through the Camera of Barry Feinstein, 2005) weaves the story of this monumental period of Dylan's life and music through revealing insider portraits, exclusive photos, live concert video and TV footage from 1975-1981, with visits to Rundown Studios, the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, the Vineyard Church, and the Fox Warfield Theatre.",

Anchored by former \"Almost Live\" cast members John Keister and Bob Nelson, \"The John Report With Bob\" featured a bevy of very talented performers from various local sketch comedy groups.  After a strong premier in April of 2000, the show began a sharp drop off the radar; with the last new episodes produced in the fall of 2000 and finally being pulled from the air by February 2001.  Viewers had apparently expected a clone of \"Almost Live,\" and due to the show's slightly different format (one which presumably attempted to allow room for greater growth through relying less on local satire) viewers never really caught on.  The quality of the show began to suffer, and fighting \"Saturday Night Live\" in its time slot probably didn't help much.The show had many bright spots, including performers Winlar and Brad Upton, to add to the solid foundation of writing and performance provided by Keister and Nelson; guest stars included Louie Anderson.  If you have the means, I highly recommend watching a few episodes.  It's a shame it failed so quickly.",

Anything and everything he could get his hands on. As little Bobby grew up, his passion for the Ikea product grew along with him and eventually led to his position with the company: Director of Marketing, North America. The high profile promotion, coupled with the excitement of the annual Spring Sale, caused Bob to develop a rather peculiar disorder: \"Ikea Specific Tourettes-Like Syndrome.\" The disease advanced quickly, and what started as simple ticks and spouting furniture 'profanities,' soon advanced to complete obsession, sexual dysfunction and indecent exposure. After extensive testing and no cure in site, the Ikea Corporation was compelled to remove Bob from his position and affectively suspend the annual Spring Sale indefinitely. \"The Story Of Bob\" provides for us an inside glance into this troubling new disorder. Through reenactments, and never before seen interviews, the filmmakers were able to explore the inner workings of Ikea Corporation and the troubling Ikea-Obsessed world of Robert Bobson.",

John Smiley who is always doubtful of the success of Bob's engineering schemes, and Thompson being on the inside of the coop, John calls for Bob to come out and take a look at the house. The master builder weighs three hundred pounds and finds that the windows and door are all too small to permit him to make an exit. There is only one thing to do, and that is to chop his way out. This he does, with much show of temper. That night the party goes to Bob's house and tells Vivian, Bob's daughter to tell her father that his friends have come to congratulate him. Bob sends word out that he wants nothing more to do with them, and the bunch retire, disappointed, but realizing that there is nothing doing.",

But the engineering and surveying was at fault; they had not measured the boat and the exit of the cellar. These important qualities did not match and the question at point was, how to get the craft out. The idea of sawing the boat in halves was impossible, the only thing to be done was to knock in the wall of the cellar and dig an exit. This was done and finally the tub was carried down to the river. The proud ship-builders got in and pulled out, when it was discovered that it had not been well caulked. It took water and was rapidly filling. Vivian, Bob's daughter, and the hired man saw the peril and Vivian really did love Clarence. John, the hired man, quickly got a motorboat and motored to the rescue. All lives were saved, and, as the three men at home soaked their feet in mustard and water, they declared, \"Never again.\"",

The men leave Vivian in the car, and tying a rope to the machine, proceed to haul it until they can find a garage. Though slow, they are getting along all right until going down a hill Vivian, who is at the wheel, runs the car into a wall and smashes it. By this time all are pretty well worn out and disgusted. Bob gets sore and declares he will pull no further, and he walks off, followed by the rest. Finally, after a long hike, they reach home and Bob falls exhausted into a chair, Kemp, John and Clarence come in and try to console him, but Bob chases them out and they beat it very lively, swearing \"Never again.\"",

While Bob is at school she gives Rowdy to the milkman, who carries him off in triumph. Bob returns from school and his first thought is of his pet. He calls and whistles, but Rowdy does not respond. After a vain search through the house he tries the street. Here he is informed of his mother's transaction with the milkman by his little friend next door. Bob at once prepares to trail his four-footed pal. From a bill in the kitchen he learns the milkman's address, then breaking open his savings bank and taking his savings, he starts on his journey. He finally locates the milkman's house and after a few minutes of whistling and calling, Rowdy rushes pell mell into his arms, trailing a broken rope as evidence of his struggle in answer to his master's call. Bob now decides to lay his course to the wild and woolly west. Nobody loves him and his dog so they might as well go away. He stops at a small post office and writes a postal card to his parents, saying that he and Rowdy are on their way out west to catch bears for the zoo and bids them farewell. Not wishing to cause them unnecessary worry, he sends the card by special delivery and trudges on his way. Meantime the household has been thrown into an uproar over Bob's disappearance and a thorough search fails to uncover any clew. Suddenly a boy delivers the postal card and taking the postmark as a clew, his father and mother hurry away in their automobile. Arriving at the post office they learn that Bob had been there and hurry away in the direction he was last seen going. Bob, not accustomed to long trips afoot, soon becomes tuckered out and along toward sunset, succumbs to fatigue and stops to rest. A few minutes later he is sound asleep by the roadside with faithful Rowdy keeping watch over his master. Here his parents find him. All is forgiven and they hustle him into the automobile, leaving poor Rowdy out in the cold, but Bob refuses to desert his little comrade and a compromise is affected by a promise to Bob to restore Rowdy to his former position as a member of the household.",

Now the senor, her father, has other plans for his daughter and is not overpleased at the prospect of an alliance with the dashing young American officer, in fact he has long cherished a desire to unite his fortune with that of Don Sancho de Salvatore, a man of noble blood and vast estates. Bob has arranged to meet his fair one at an appointed time and the hour has scarcely struck when through the gates strides the dauntless young lieutenant. He is not aware of a pair of evil eyes that follow him. Don Salvatore, already aware of the success of his rival's suit, has placed a spy near his friend's abode to keep close watch on the fair senorita and the hated Americano. Hurrying to the home of Don Salvatore. Pedro, the spy, acquaints the Don with the news that Bob is already within the gates of Cavera's home and perhaps is even now making desperate love to the daughter. With an oath the jealous suitor seizes his sombrero and hastens away to interrupt the lieutenant in his love making. In the meantime Don Cavera has discovered the presence of the two lovers in the garden and is angrily upbraiding his daughter for daring to bring a stranger within his gates, unknown to him, when Salvatore arrives. Now we are given a little exhibition of the senorita's spirit and the American's nerve, when the father and jealous suitor are both told that in spite of them Senorita Magdalena would become the wife of Robert Willard if he bad to wade through fire and water to accomplish that end. Kissing his sweetheart good-night before the dumbfounded Dons and lifting his cap to Senora Cavera, Magdalena's mother, Bob strides away, vowing that if necessary he would fight for his lady love as did the knights of old. Returning to his ship he sends a middy with a message to the Senorita telling her to meet him near the walls of the old Cabrillado that evening at 1 o'clock, when they would at once repair to the church and by the good father be made one. Together they hurry to the old church and their marriage is soon consummated. But the watchful Pedro overhears enough of their plans to divine the rest and loses no time in bearing the news to his master. Boiling with rage. Don Salvatore secures the services of two policemen and hastens to the wharf. They are just in time to overtake the wedding party as they are boarding the ship's launch. The police attempt to seize the senorita, but they did not reckon on the presence of a squad of Yankee tars, who would follow Bob into the jaws of death, if necessary, and it only takes a word from him to set that bunch of sailors in action. Springing up in all directions, Bob's boys soon overpower the police, and lifting them above their heads, send them floundering out into the water. \"You shall answer for this indignity,\" screams the now maddened Salvatore, but before he has time to say another word the jolly tars send him sprawling after the police, who are by this time swimming as fast as they can out of danger. Springing on the launch, a ringing cheer is sent up for the Yankee lieutenant and his beautiful bride. Bob secures a leave of absence from duty, and when his ship drops anchor in an American port, he and his young wife proceed to enjoy the honeymoon that the brave and fair so richly merit.",

Dulcina Garnia, Bob's sweetheart, is beloved by Ladero. Manuel Garni, her guardian, has promised her in marriage to Ladero for assisting the revolutionists. Bob determines to give his aid to General Braga, and accompanied by his two chums, Cyrus Browa and Comin Hartley, he embarks on Brown's yacht for Lorento. Realizing that Dulcina will not marry him because she loves Bob, Ladero kidnaps her at the instigation of her guardian, intending to force her to marry him. When Bob has left Dulcina to visit General Braga, Ladero's men make away with Dulcina and confine her in a monastery. Riaz, leader of the kidnappers, has gone to the Tavern Verduga, where Bob is in consultation with the general. Dulcina's maid finds Bob there, tells him of Dulcina's plight, and points out Riaz as one of the kidnappers. Bob and his two chums grab Riaz, take him to the yacht, and force a confession from him. Riaz escapes from them by jumping overboard. Ladero, receiving no news from Riaz. sets out with his men for the monastery. Riaz has secured a horse and intends to head off Bob. Ladero has found a priest who is about to marry him to Dulcina but she succeeds in secretly notifying the priest of her predicament and he aids her to escape. She meets Riaz, who forces her into a telegraph station, where the operator is drunk. Kicking the operator out, he attempts to assault Dulcina, who picks up a revolver and shoots him. Bob and his pals have reached the monastery, have a fight with the band of kidnappers, and Bob sees the priest who tells him of Dulcina's escape, and they set out to find her. Ladero on his way to the monastery hears the shot fired by Dulcina and reaches the station as Dulcina is about to rush out. Bob meets the operator, disguises himself in his uniform, locates Dulcina, unseen by Ladero, overhears a message read by Ladero that the president is dead and for him to join Mendoza, and he sees him start away. Ladero has ordered his men to fire on the station. Bob's chums, hearing the firing, come to Bob's aid. Mendoza and Ladero's men attack Braga's forces in the city amid terrific gunfire of infantry, and the cavalry have a tremendous fight which ends in a complete routing of Ladero's supporters. When Bob and his friends are about to give up hope of holding off the outlaws. General Braga and his soldiers arrive to rescue them. Eventually Bob is proclaimed president for his services and is married to Dulcina.",

Soon, the neck strip is removed and the cape undone, Tracy runs her hands through her hair, realizing that all of her hair isn't gone.

As well as iconic venues on Lower Broadway and the historic hit factories of 16th Avenue, Bob also explores the East Nashville music scene and discovers a rebellious flipside to the country coin. With exclusive performances from the city's top talent, Bob explains why country music owes its enduring success to Nashville's unique nurturing community of songwriters.

They are also at the core of the documentary; City Slickers Can't Stay With Me. City Slickers Can't Stay With Me tells the story of Hall of Fame distance running coach Bob Larsen, tracing his extraordinary career from his roots at San Diego State through coaching at Monte Vista High, Grossmont College, and then his 20 record-breaking years at UCLA. Framing the film's narrative is Coach Larsen's collaboration with long-time protege, Marathon Champion, Meb Keflezighi, and their pivotal role- along with Deena Kastor and Coach Joe Vigil- in rebuilding the status of American long distance running internationally. Mebrahtom (Meb) Keflezighi is a world class distance runner with a unique American success story. Born during a war of Independence in Eritrea, Meb and his family were forced to flee the war torn country when he was only 10 years old. They eventually settled in San Diego, CA, setting Meb on a path to represent the United States as an Olympic distance runner in 2000, 2004, and 2012, winning the Silver Medal in 2004 marathon. Through Meb, City Slickers Can't Stay With Me reminds us that great achievements are rarely made on one's own. The film features breathtaking footage, including Meb's victory at the Boston Marathon in 2014 (the first American man to win Boston in 31 years), plus training at altitude in Mammoth Lakes, rare photos and exclusive, in-depth interviews with running greats such as Meb, Deena, Alberto Salazar and many more. City Slickers Can't Stay With Me illustrates what continues to make Coach Bob Larsen such an influential figure in his field. His ability to galvanize the emotional, intellectual, and physiological components of his runners has garnered unwavering respect from his athletes, former athletes, his peers, and has produced winning teams and star athletes from unlikely circumstances.",

Winning the Olympic Gold Medal for the United States in 1948 at the age of seventeen, and again in 1952, Mathias, who would have tried out for the 1956 games but was barred by the Olympic committee because he starred in a biographical movie, playing himself, went on to become a well-known actor, then a U.S. Congressman. In this fifty- two minute documentary we go to Mathias hometown of Tulare, California to trace his story, and we also go to nearby Fresno to interview Mathias (his last interview ever given before his death in 2006). Bob Mathias was a true American Hero who tried to make a difference.",
